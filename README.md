## Requirements
CMake &ge; 2.8

## Build instructions
The project uses CMake as a build system.

On UNIX systems you can generate a Makefile with the command:

Then you should be able to compile the project properly with:

    make

You can clear the files generated by CMake with:

    ./clear_cmake_generated_files
