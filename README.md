## TODO
Make Lua independant of the video (avcodec AND SDL2).

## Build instructions
The project uses CMake as a build system.

On UNIX systems you can generate a Makefile with the command:

    cmake . -G"Unix Makefiles"

Then you should be able to compile the project properly with:

    make

You can clear the files generated by CMake with:

    ./clear_cmake_generated_files
